# Memory Model

Perry compiles TypeScript directly to native code via LLVM, but JavaScript is a managed language: closures escape, objects outlive scopes, cycles exist. This page explains how Perry reconciles "native binary" with "garbage-collected language" — the value representation, the heap layout, how the GC finds roots, and how LLVM-generated code cooperates with the collector.

If you've ever wondered "does Perry use reference counting?" — no. There is no `Rc` at runtime. Perry has a real tracing GC, described below.

For the dated source of truth on shipped collection paths, target-specific
root lowerings, memory pressure, block pooling, supported knobs, and CI, see
[Garbage collector: current architecture and operations](https://docs.perryts.com/internals/garbage-collector.html).

## Value representation: NaN-boxing

Every JavaScript value in Perry is a single 64-bit word. The encoding piggy-backs on IEEE 754: any `f64` whose exponent is all-ones and whose mantissa is non-zero is a NaN, and there are ~2⁵² distinct NaN bit patterns. Perry uses the high 16 bits as a type tag and the low 48 (or 32) bits as the payload.

| Tag (high 16 bits) | Type | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `0x7FFC…0001` | `undefined` | — (singleton) |
| `0x7FFC…0002` | `null` | — (singleton) |
| `0x7FFC…0003` | `false` | — (singleton) |
| `0x7FFC…0004` | `true` | — (singleton) |
| `0x7FF9` | Short string (0–5 bytes) | length in bits 40–47, the bytes in bits 0–39 — no allocation |
| `0x7FFA` | BigInt | low 48 bits = heap pointer |
| `0x7FFB` | JS handle | low 48 bits = handle id (V8-backed objects) |
| `0x7FFD` | Object / Array / Closure | low 48 bits = heap pointer |
| `0x7FFE` | Int32 | low 32 bits = signed int |
| `0x7FFF` | String | low 48 bits = heap pointer |
| anything else | `f64` | the full 64 bits are the number |

Source: `crates/perry-runtime/src/value/tags.rs` (the singleton and pointer tags),
with the rest of the `value/` module tree for the encode/decode helpers.
`TAG_HOLE` and `TAG_TDZ` are two further `0x7FFC` singletons the runtime uses
internally; they are not user-observable values.

Three consequences worth noting:

1. **Numbers are free.** A plain `f64` value is its own representation — no boxing, no header, no allocation. Numeric hot loops cost nothing in memory traffic.
2. **The GC can identify pointer values from the tag alone.** When tracing a value, the collector masks the high bits, checks for `0x7FFA`/`0x7FFD`/`0x7FFF`, and either follows the low-48-bit pointer or skips. There is no per-value runtime type lookup.
3. **Type checks are bitwise.** `typeof` and many fast paths in the runtime are register-level mask-and-compare operations.

## Heap layout: per-thread arena, nursery + old-gen

Perry is single-threaded by default, and each thread owns its own heap. Sharing across threads happens via deep copy (`SerializedValue`), not shared memory, so the GC never has to synchronize across threads.

Within a thread, the heap is two arenas:

- **`ARENA`** — the nursery. New allocations land here. Carved into 1 MB blocks (since v0.5.196).
- **`OLD_ARENA`** — the old generation. Holds objects that have survived enough minor GCs to be tenured.

Every allocation, in either arena, is prefixed by an 8-byte `GcHeader`
(`crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/types.rs`):

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct GcHeader {
    pub obj_type: u8,    // GC_TYPE_ARRAY, GC_TYPE_STRING, …
    pub gc_flags: u8,    // MARKED | ARENA | PINNED | TENURED | HAS_SURVIVED | …
    pub _reserved: u16,
    pub size: u32,       // total alloc size, used for arena block walking
}
```

Callers receive a pointer **after** the header (`ptr + 8`), so from TypeScript code's perspective the header is invisible. The collector finds the header by subtracting 8.

Allocation goes through `gc_malloc(size, obj_type)` in the `gc/` module tree.
LLVM-generated code emits calls to this for every object literal, array
literal, closure capture, string concat, BigInt operation, etc. Going through
the GC allocation funnel is how the collector accounts for memory and decides
when to collect.

## How the GC finds roots

This is the part most people are surprised by: if Perry compiles through LLVM, the optimizer is free to keep values in registers, spill them to stack slots, rematerialize them — none of which the collector can introspect. So how does the collector know which JS values are live?

Three mechanisms cover different storage locations:

### 1. Target-aware precise roots (codegen-emitted)

One pointer-local analysis feeds two correct lowerings. On supported 64-bit
AArch64/arm64 and x86-64 targets, native RS4GC statepoints plus Perry's compact
stack map are the default. `arm64_32` watchOS, ARM64 Windows, and unsupported
architectures use Perry's heap-backed shadow frames. The fallback is a root
lowering, not an unrooted mode; see [the current GC page](https://docs.perryts.com/internals/garbage-collector.html#roots-by-target).

At a safepoint the selected map describes each live managed local regardless of
whether LLVM kept it in a register, spilled it, or relocated it.

### 2. Conservative native-stack diagnostic

The production default does not scan the native stack conservatively: `Auto`
resolves to `SkipDisabled`. `PERRY_CONSERVATIVE_STACK_SCAN=full` is a diagnostic
sensitivity arm that scans words which look like arena pointers and pins the
corresponding objects for that cycle. Because an ambiguous root cannot be
rewritten safely, this arm makes the copying minor ineligible.

### 3. Registered runtime root scanners

Some roots live in the runtime itself, not in user code: pending Promises,
timer callbacks, exception state, async-context stacks, shape caches, overflow
fields, parse scratch tables, and intern tables. The collector invokes the
registered scanners during marking; `scripts/gc_runtime_root_holders.py`
enumerates the holders and refuses unclassified or stale inventory entries.

## Generational behaviour

Most JS allocations die young — object literals in a loop body, short-lived closures, intermediate strings. A generational collector exploits this by collecting the nursery frequently and the old gen rarely.

Aging is recorded two different ways, because the two minor paths need different
things from it.

**The non-copying minor** uses two flag bits in `gc_flags`
(`crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/types.rs`): `GC_FLAG_HAS_SURVIVED` on the first
minor an object survives, `GC_FLAG_TENURED` on the second, at which point the
object is logically promoted. The two-bit scheme avoids a counter field in the
header, and a tenured object initially stays physically where it is — that
promotion is a flag flip, not a copy. Whether such objects are then evacuated
into `OLD_ARENA` (with every reference rewritten) is a policy decision taken per
cycle from nursery/RSS pressure and measured movable candidates, and it requires
generated write barriers to be active.

**The copying minor** — the default nursery path — stores an exact short age in
the header instead, and its promotion threshold is *adaptive*: a
survivor-occupancy feedback loop picks the largest number of survivals whose projected
survivor occupancy still fits, capped at 4, and locks to 1 (promote on first
copy) when the aging round is measurably filtering nothing. There is no fixed
`PROMOTION_AGE` and no knob; `crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tenuring.rs` is the
definition.

When a copying minor's whole young generation measures (near-)entirely live it
does not copy at all: the blocks change generation in place. The current GC page
covers that path, its thresholds, and its footprint budgets —
[Aging, promotion, and where an object is born](https://docs.perryts.com/internals/garbage-collector.html#aging-promotion-and-where-an-object-is-born).

### Write barriers and the remembered set

Generational collectors have one fundamental problem: if an old-gen object points to a young-gen object, a minor GC (which only traces the nursery) needs to know about that pointer or it will free a live object.

The fix is a **write barrier**: every time a pointer field is written, the runtime checks "is this old → young?" and, if so, records the parent in a **remembered set**. Minor GCs treat remembered-set entries as additional roots.

In Perry, codegen emits write-barrier calls by default so copied minor GC and
evacuation can rely on exact remembered-set data. Set
`PERRY_WRITE_BARRIERS=0`/`off`/`false` during compile for bisection; at runtime,
the same setting disables exact helper barriers. Generational minors then fall
back to full mark-sweep rather than trusting an empty remembered set.

## Triggers and tuning

`gc_check_trigger` in `gc/policy.rs` responds to four signal families:

1. **Nursery pressure** — allocation growth and the adaptive nursery cap.
2. **Malloc count pressure** — too many separately tracked allocations.
3. **Major pacing** — unreclaimed post-collection bytes outgrow the live baseline.
4. **Explicit/host requests** — user `gc()` and warning/critical OS memory pressure.

Device/container budgets scale trigger and reclaim ceilings down. Released
blocks are reused thread-locally under a process-wide byte cap before allocator
return; see the current GC page for the pressure levels and the pool's cap and
drain behaviour.

## Escape hatches and diagnostics

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PERRY_GEN_GC=0` / `off` / `false` | Disable generational mode; fall back to full mark-sweep (intended for bisection only). |
| `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE=1` | With generated write barriers active and policy evacuation allowed, stress-copy every marked non-pinned nursery object instead of only tenured survivors. |
| `PERRY_GC_VERIFY_EVACUATION=1` | After an evacuation that actually forwards objects, panic if any mutable live slot still points at a forwarded nursery object after rewrite. |
| `PERRY_WRITE_BARRIERS=0` / `off` / `false` | Disable codegen-emitted write barriers at compile time and runtime exact helper barriers at runtime for benchmark/debug bisection. Unset, `=1`, `=on`, and `=true` keep barriers enabled. |
| `PERRY_GC_DIAG=1` | Print per-cycle diagnostics, including one evacuation-policy line for cycles where evacuation was considered and for `barriers_inactive` skips. |

## Rooting-bug instruments

A value that is live but not rooted across a collection point leaves nothing
behind at collection time — there is literally nothing for the collector to
find. The nursery then recycles the address immediately, so the stale pointer
reads a valid unrelated object and the program dies a cycle or more later, in a
different function, as `TypeError: value is not a function`. These knobs exist
to collapse that detection latency. **All are default-off and inert when off.**

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE=1` | After an **evacuating (copying) minor**, do not recycle from-space. Retired Eden and active-survivor blocks are detached into a bounded quarantine, filled with a poison pattern whose first byte reads as an invalid `obj_type` (`0xDE`), and `mprotect(PROT_NONE)`'d over their page-aligned interior. A stale dereference then SIGSEGVs **at the faulting instruction**, with the holder still on the stack. The installed reporter prints the faulting address, which minor retired it, and the last-known object that lived there (`obj_type`, size) plus a native backtrace, then restores `SIG_DFL` and returns so the instruction re-faults — a core file or debugger still sees the real crash site. |
| `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE=poison` | As above without `mprotect`: poison only. Use where a fault is unwanted, or for the sub-page block edges `mprotect` cannot cover (those are always poison-filled and counted separately). |
| `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH=N` | How many retired page-sets stay quarantined (default `4`, minimum `1`). Expired sets are restored to read/write and **recycled back into Eden**, never freed, so the quarantine is a ring: steady-state footprint is bounded by `N × from-space bytes` and no `mprotect`'d page is ever handed to the system allocator. |
| `PERRY_GC_FROMSPACE_SCAN_ABORT=1` | Abort on the **first** offending slot the whole-heap from-space scan finds, printing slot, holder, target (including the target's `obj_type`) and a collector backtrace. Now implies `PERRY_GC_FROMSPACE_SCAN=1`; previously it was silently inert on its own. |
| `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED=<u64>` | **Seeded GC-schedule fuzzing** — when nursery pressure is not due, add a minor collection at a handled safepoint when a deterministic pseudo-random function of the seed and a per-thread safepoint ordinal selects it. It never *suppresses* a pressure-driven collection; the rate is additional density on top of normal pacing. A failing seed is a reproducer. The schedule implies forced evacuation unconditionally; #7611 deleted the ambient evacuation veto that could silently disarm this instrument. It does **not** bypass `gc_safepoint_moving_minor`'s entry guards (in-allocation, suppressed, unsafe FFI zone, non-zero root-lock depth, budgeted cycle): a safepoint reached in any of those states still declines to collect, and does not consume a schedule slot. A value that does not parse as a `u64` reads as OFF, not as seed 0. Composes with the two above; that pairing is what turns a rooting bug into an immediate precise fault. |
| `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_RATE=<0..1>` | Expected fraction of eligible handled safepoints that receive an *additional* schedule-triggered collection (default `0.05`). Inert without a seed. `0` selects nothing but still installs the banner and reporters, so it is a clean control arm; `1` collects at every handled safepoint — maximum pressure, in the spirit of V8's `--stress-scavenge`, and the point where the seed stops mattering because every ordinal is selected. Out-of-range values clamp. |

These instruments have explicit caveats, because each has burned a prior
investigation:

- `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE` gates **only** the copying minor's from-space
  reset. A run with the knob on and zero copying minors protects nothing. Check
  for a `[gc-fromspace-protect] retired_set=#N` line under `PERRY_GC_DIAG=1`.
- **Depth is the knob to raise when a suspected bug does not fault.** A stale
  pointer is only caught while the page-set it names is still quarantined, and
  at `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED=<u64> PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_RATE=1
  PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_ALLOC_KB=0` a value can cross hundreds of collections between
  its last valid observation and its stale use — one per loop back-edge poll.
  (`ALLOC_KB=0` is what makes that literally per-poll: rate 1 selects every
  *candidate*, and the default 4 KB stride only makes a poll a candidate once
  that much new nursery material has accumulated.) On #7154's
  `new C(…)` reproducer the constructor body runs 600 polls, so the caller's
  stale register is 600 retirements old by the time the return-override
  publishes it: the default depth of 4 misses it silently, and
  `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH=800` faults on the first use. Rule of thumb:
  depth ≥ the number of safepoints the suspect value survives.
- `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED` cannot select loop back-edge polls that codegen never
  produced. Those are a **compile-time** property (`PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS`, default
  ON since #7721; a binary compiled with `=0` has none). Without them, a seeded
  run only fires at event-loop boundaries and a compute-only loop never
  collects at all — check the exit summary's `loop_polls=` before trusting a
  clean sweep. At `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_RATE=1` you no longer have to remember:
  the run prints a `[gc-schedule]` verdict at exit and **exits 70** when it
  forced or moved nothing, so a vacuous run is a red run rather than a green
  one. Sub-endpoint rates get the summary line but no hard verdict (a sparse
  seed legitimately forcing nothing is not a broken instrument).
- **`PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED`'s determinism is per-thread, and that is the honest
  scope.** The safepoint counter is thread-local: no wall clock, no address, no
  thread identity enters the decision, so a **single-threaded** program replays
  a seed exactly. A `perry/thread` program gets a deterministic schedule *per
  thread given that thread's own safepoint sequence*, but nothing makes the OS
  schedule that sequence identically twice, so a multi-threaded reproducer is
  only as reproducible as its threading. A global counter would be strictly
  worse — it would make even a single thread's schedule depend on interleaving.
  Report which case you measured.
- **A clean sweep means nothing without a safepoint count.** The mode prints
  `[gc-schedule] done: seed=… safepoints=… scheduled_collections=…` at exit, and
  `scripts/gc_schedule_fuzz.sh` refuses to call a sweep clean when every run
  reported zero safepoints — the usual cause being a binary compiled without
  `PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS=1`, which has no in-loop safepoints for a schedule
  to select.
- **Page protection is Unix-only.** `mprotect` / `sigaction` / `sysconf` are not
  exposed by the `libc` crate on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, a target
  `perry-runtime` is genuinely built for. On non-Unix hosts `=1` degrades to
  `poison`, which is visible rather than silent: `bytes_protected` stays `0`
  while `bytes_poisoned` counts the whole retired range.

## Why this design

The combination—NaN-boxing, per-thread arenas, target-aware precise roots,
registered runtime scanners, barriers, and generational aging—is what lets
Perry go through LLVM and still run a moving managed heap.

Going to native code does not preclude having a GC. It means the collector's
relationship with compiled code is mediated by an ABI and the selected root
map; the linked runtime remains a real tracing collector. There is nothing
reference-counted at runtime.

## Profiling Perry's memory on macOS

Two things to know before reading `vmmap`, Instruments' VM Tracker, or
`footprint` output for a Perry binary:

- **The heap does not show up under `MALLOC_*`.** Perry routes all runtime
  allocation through mimalloc (`#[global_allocator]`, issue #62), whose
  mappings appear as their own anonymous regions, not in the system malloc
  zones.
- **Those regions used to render as `IOAccelerator`** — i.e. GPU driver
  memory — because mimalloc tags its mappings with VM tag 100, which macOS
  tooling decodes as `IOAccelerator`. The runtime retags them to
  `VM_MEMORY_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_1` (240), so the JS heap shows up as
  **`Memory Tag 240`** and there is no GPU memory involved. Set
  `MIMALLOC_OS_TAG=<n>` to steer the tag yourself — the runtime defers to an
  explicit env setting.

  The retag runs from a `__DATA,__mod_init_func` constructor
  (`perry-runtime/src/mimalloc_os_tag.rs`), *not* from `js_gc_init`, and that
  placement is load-bearing: mimalloc reserves a 1 GiB arena on its first
  allocation — during `std`'s pre-`main` startup — and every later allocation
  just commits pages inside that already-tagged region, so setting the option
  from any Rust code, `main` included, retags nothing that matters. #6882 set
  it from `js_gc_init` and was therefore inert for the whole heap until #7450
  moved it pre-`main`. On a build between those two, expect ~all of the heap
  as `IOAccelerator` and a token `Memory Tag 240` region.

  So: large `IOAccelerator` regions on a current build are a *bug*, not a
  documentation caveat — most likely the module initializer was dropped from
  the link. `crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tests/os_tag.rs` asserts the real
  thing (the kernel's `user_tag` for a live heap address, via
  `mach_vm_region`); note that `mi_option_get(mi_option_os_tag)` reports 240
  in the broken case too, so it is not a diagnosis.

Also note that mimalloc purges freed memory with `MADV_FREE`-style advice:
macOS keeps such pages counted in RSS and `phys_footprint` until memory
pressure, so headline RSS numbers overstate what the process would actually
hold onto under pressure.

Perry uses a per-thread, tracing generational collector. JavaScript values are
NaN-boxed, allocations carry an 8-byte `GcHeader`, and each runtime thread owns
a nursery plus an old-generation arena. The implementation is the
`crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/` and `crates/perry-runtime/src/arena/` module
trees; code generation's root lowering lives in
`crates/perry-codegen/src/codegen/` and `native_root_coverage/`.

## Collection paths

New GC-managed allocations normally enter 1 MiB nursery blocks
<!-- gc-fact: BLOCK_SIZE = 1024 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/arena/block.rs -->.
A collection can take one of three paths:

1. **Copying minor.** At a precise safepoint, live young objects are copied,
   roots and heap slots are rewritten, and whole from-space blocks are reset.
   Survivors that have aged out are promoted into `OLD_ARENA`. This is the fast
   nursery path, and it has a whole-block variant described below.
2. **Non-moving minor/fallback.** When collection begins somewhere that cannot
   safely relocate every live reference, the nursery is marked and swept in
   place. Budgeted low-pause cycles also use a non-moving path. This is the path
   the flat `HAS_SURVIVED` → `TENURED` flag pair ages objects on.
3. **Full mark-sweep.** Major pacing, critical host pressure, explicit full
   work, or `PERRY_GEN_GC=0` trace both generations and reclaim dead old objects
   as well as nursery garbage.

`PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE` is on by default and lets nursery pressure route to the
direct minor. `PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE_NURSERY_MB` tunes its base high-water cap,
16 MiB by default
<!-- gc-fact: SCAVENGE_NURSERY_CAP_DEFAULT_MB = 16 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/policy.rs -->;
tenuring feedback may grow the effective cap by up to 4×
<!-- gc-fact: NURSERY_CAP_SCALE_MAX = 4 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tenuring.rs -->
on live-set-bound workloads, where a fixed cap would multiply the per-collection
fixed cost by an enormous collection count. Generated write barriers are also on
by default. Turning them off makes generational minors unsound, so the runtime
deliberately falls back to full mark-sweep.

Old-generation page defragmentation is implemented, including the mutable-root
rewrite contract that relocating an old page requires, but it is **opt-in**:
`select_old_page_defrag_pages` returns an empty selection unless
`PERRY_GC_OLD_DEFRAG=1`. It shipped on by default once and was reverted, because
no fragmentation workload in the corpus exercises it — turning it back on is
gated on a stress corpus existing, not on the contract. Nursery evacuation and
normal old-generation sweep are unaffected either way.

## Aging, promotion, and where an object is born

The copying minor's tenuring threshold is **adaptive, not fixed**: it is the
largest number of survivals `S` whose projected survivor occupancy still fits
the desired survivor size, clamped to a ceiling of 4
<!-- gc-fact: GC_COPY_PROMOTION_SURVIVALS = 4 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/layout.rs -->,
and it drops to 1 (promote on first copy) when a measured survival-rate lock
shows the aging round is filtering nothing. The loop is always on and has no env
knob; `crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tenuring.rs` is its definition and states the
feedback signal it uses.

**Whole-block in-place promotion.** When the previous cycle measured a
young-survival ratio at or above 95%
<!-- gc-fact: PROMOTE_SURVIVAL_THRESHOLD_PERMILLE = 950 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/promote_in_place.rs -->,
the next copying minor relabels the young blocks as old-gen instead of
evacuating them object by object: nothing moves, so nothing in the heap or in
any address-keyed side table is rewritten. A promoting cycle still traces — that
is what keeps the next cycle's decision measured rather than assumed — except in
the fully-live regime at or above 98%
<!-- gc-fact: UNTRACED_PROMOTION_SURVIVAL_PERMILLE = 980 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/promote_in_place.rs -->,
where the trace itself is skipped and every object on the block is registered as
live. Two budgets bound the retained garbage that costs: a running cap on
promoted dead bytes
<!-- gc-fact: PROMOTED_DEAD_BUDGET_BYTES = 32 * 1024 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/promote_in_place.rs -->
and an untraced-promotion floor
<!-- gc-fact: UNTRACED_PROMOTION_FLOOR_BYTES = 128 * 1024 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/promote_in_place.rs -->
that forces a measuring cycle before the assumption can run away. A full
collection resets both. `PERRY_GC_PROMOTE_IN_PLACE=0` reverts to
object-by-object evacuation, and the knobs that exist to make objects *move*
(`PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE`, a resolved `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED`) turn the path
off outright rather than silently stop exercising their own subject.
<!-- gc-symbol: in_place_promotion_leaves_the_object_at_its_address_in_old_gen in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tests/promote_in_place.rs -->
<!-- gc-symbol: promote_in_place_knob_parses_both_states in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tests/promote_in_place.rs -->

**Born-old thresholds are type-dependent.** A pointer-free allocation above
16 KiB
<!-- gc-fact: LARGE_OBJECT_THRESHOLD_BYTES = 16 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/types.rs -->
is born in old-gen; a pointer-bearing one stays nursery-resident until 128 KiB
<!-- gc-fact: LARGE_POINTER_BEARING_OBJECT_THRESHOLD_BYTES = 128 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/types.rs -->.
The split matters when reading a survival ratio: a flat threshold sends the
intermediate backing stores of a growing array straight to old-gen, so the
garbage they abandon never appears in the young generation at all.

## Roots, by target

One root-set analysis feeds two lowerings:

| target | shipped precise-root lowering |
|---|---|
| 64-bit AArch64/arm64 and x86-64, including x86-64 Windows | LLVM RS4GC statepoints plus Perry's compact native stack map |
| `arm64_32` watchOS, ARM64 Windows, and unsupported architectures | Perry shadow frames |

This is target-aware, not host-aware. `PERRY_RS4GC=0` selects the shadow
lowering for bisection; `PERRY_RS4GC=1` requests native roots and fails closed
if the target cannot emit/read them. `PERRY_SHADOW_STACK=0` disables only the
shadow lowering—native-root analysis remains enabled when native roots are the
selected backend.

Runtime-owned roots do not live in generated frames. Registered scanners visit
module globals, pending async work, caches, registries, and other side tables;
`scripts/gc_runtime_root_holders.py` keeps the inventory complete. Runtime
helpers keep temporary values in `RuntimeHandleScope`/`RuntimeHandle` and must
re-read a handle after a call that can collect.

The conservative native-stack scan is not part of the production default:
`Auto` resolves to `SkipDisabled`. `PERRY_CONSERVATIVE_STACK_SCAN=full` is an
explicit diagnostic/sensitivity arm. A full scan pins ambiguous roots and
therefore makes the copying minor ineligible; it is useful evidence, not a
second normal rooting backend.

## Barriers and weak references

Every old-to-young pointer publication must hit the remembered-set barrier.
Codegen emits barriers for generated heap stores and runtime helpers perform
the same bookkeeping for their own exact stores. A minor traces remembered old
parents instead of retracing all of old-gen.

WeakRef, WeakMap, WeakSet, and FinalizationRegistry targets are excluded from
the strong trace. Weak processing is **registry-scoped on every path**: the
copying minor visits registered weak holders and repairs forwarded addresses,
and full/fallback collection snapshots the holder registry and consumes a
bounded number of holders per step (`FullWeakProcessingState` in
`crates/perry-runtime/src/weakref.rs`), so the work is O(registered weak
holders) rather than O(arena) and a budgeted cycle can return to the mutator
between holders.
<!-- gc-symbol: full_atomic_finalize_slices_weak_holders_with_tiny_budget in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tests/cycle_state.rs -->

## Budgets, memory pressure, and released blocks

The collector derives a heap budget, in priority order, from
`PERRY_GC_HEAP_LIMIT` (MiB), Apple embedded available-memory APIs, container
limits, then half of physical RAM. Budgets below 1 GiB scale trigger ceilings,
reclaim thresholds, nursery deferral slack, and RSS pressure thresholds down;
desktop/server defaults remain unchanged.

Platform hosts call `js_gc_memory_pressure(level)`:

- warning (`1`) requests a prompt minor;
- critical (`2+`) requests a full collection so old-gen garbage and idle arena
  blocks can be reclaimed;
- if collection is unsafe, the request is made sticky and drains at the next
  precise safepoint/allocation check.

Released 1 MiB blocks first enter a **per-thread LIFO reuse pool under a
process-wide byte cap**. The reuse order is thread-local; the budget is not — a
single global reservation is what bounds N live agents to one allowance instead
of N of them. The cap is derived by `gc_block_pool_cap_with_budget` in
`crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/heap_budget.rs`: 64 MiB
<!-- gc-fact: BLOCK_POOL_CAP_DEFAULT_BYTES = 64 * 1024 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/heap_budget.rs -->
on an unconstrained desktop/server process, scaled to one eighth of a
device/container budget with a 1 MiB floor. Overflow is returned to the
allocator, thread exit drains that thread's pool, and a critical-pressure drain
request is sticky: it survives unsafe/deferred periods and empties the pool when
the owed full collection finishes its arena reclamation.
<!-- gc-symbol: block_pool_cap_is_process_wide_across_live_threads in crates/perry-runtime/src/arena/tests.rs -->
<!-- gc-symbol: deferred_critical_pressure_drains_after_the_owed_full_cycle in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tests/block_pool_pressure.rs -->
Reported heap usage (`js_arena_stats`,
`process.memoryUsage().heapUsed`) is an exact post-collection **live census**
plus incremental deltas, not a sum of block high-water offsets.

## Supported controls

These are the operational controls most useful outside collector development:

| knob | purpose |
|---|---|
| `PERRY_GEN_GC=0` | bisection fallback to full mark-sweep |
| `PERRY_WRITE_BARRIERS=0` | compile/runtime barrier bisection; also forces full mark-sweep |
| `PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE=0` | disable direct nursery scavenging for pacing comparison |
| `PERRY_GC_PROMOTE_IN_PLACE=0` | revert whole-block promotion to object-by-object evacuation |
| `PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE_NURSERY_MB=N` | set the base nursery cap |
| `PERRY_GC_HEAP_LIMIT=N` | override the process heap budget in MiB |
| `PERRY_RS4GC=0` | select shadow roots on a native-root-capable target |
| `PERRY_CONSERVATIVE_STACK_SCAN=full` | diagnostic full native-stack scan; disables copying |
| `PERRY_GC_TRACE=1` | emit structured per-cycle trace records |
| `PERRY_GC_DIAG=1` | emit human-readable collector diagnostics |

Rooting stress uses `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED`,
`PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_RATE`, `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_ALLOC_KB`,
`PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE`, `PERRY_GC_VERIFY_EVACUATION`,
`PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE`, `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH`,
`PERRY_GC_FROMSPACE_SCAN`, and `PERRY_GC_FROMSPACE_SCAN_ABORT`. Their exact
contracts and non-vacuity requirements live in the
[rooting invariant](https://docs.perryts.com/internals/gc-rooting-invariant.html). Research/bisection controls such
as `PERRY_GC_INCREMENTAL`,
`PERRY_GC_MAJOR_PACING_FLOOR_MB`, `PERRY_GC_MAJOR_PACING_GROWTH`,
`PERRY_GC_MOVING_SAFEPOINT`, `PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS`,
`PERRY_GC_SAFEPOINT_ONLY`, and `PERRY_STACKMAP_WALKER` are accepted but are not
additional supported collector modes.

`scripts/check_gc_env_knobs.py` derives the accepted names from live
runtime/codegen/compiler parsers and rejects a current document, executable
script, workflow, or translation catalog that names a deleted knob.
`scripts/check_gc_doc_claims.py` does the same job for the rest of this page:
every path it cites must exist, every number carries a `gc-fact` marker naming
the constant it came from, and the marker is compared against that constant.
Several behavioural claims above additionally carry a `gc-symbol` marker naming
the **test** that proves them — weak-holder slicing, the process-wide pool cap,
the sticky critical-pressure drain, and in-place promotion. Deleting or renaming
one of those tests fails `lint`, and changing the behaviour fails `cargo-test`;
neither can go quiet while this page keeps claiming the old thing.

## Validation and CI authority

As of 2026-08-16, branch protection requires exactly one status, `pr-gate` — the
fan-in of `test.yml`'s PR tier (see `docs/src/testing/ci-tiers.md`; the tier
policy is `scripts/ci_plan.py`). The GC-specific coverage is split deliberately:

| check | where it runs | required status |
|---|---|---|
| root-holder custody, GC-knob drift, and this page's path/number claims | `test.yml` → `lint` | yes (via `pr-gate`) |
| runtime unit suite and `run_memory_stability_tests.sh` four-mode matrix | `test.yml` → `cargo-test` | yes (via `pr-gate`; the PR tier is diff-scoped, the sweep/full tiers run the workspace) |
| GC × representation-selection matrix, rooting-bug instruments, write-barrier stress | `test.yml` → `gc-stress` | yes (via `pr-gate`; PR subset on PRs, full matrix in the sweep) |
| emitted root dominance, including native statepoint IR | `gc-root-dominance.yml` | not branch-required; PR arm opt-in via `run-extended-tests`, six-hourly on `main` |
| pinned collector counters/RSS/wall matrix | `gc-ratchet.yml` | not branch-required; PR arm opt-in via `run-extended-tests`, six-hourly on `main` |
| thread-local mechanism/policy budget | `tls-budget.yml` | not branch-required; PR arm opt-in via `run-extended-tests`, six-hourly on `main` |

Useful local preflight commands:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_gc_env_knobs.py --self-test
python3 scripts/check_gc_env_knobs.py
python3 scripts/check_gc_doc_claims.py --self-test
python3 scripts/check_gc_doc_claims.py
python3 scripts/gc_runtime_root_holders.py --self-test
python3 scripts/gc_runtime_root_holders.py
python3 scripts/gc_root_dominance_check.py --self-test
cargo test -p perry-runtime --lib
```

The dedicated performance/rooting workflows have broader compiler and host
requirements; their workflow files are the authority for exact commands and
relevance filters.

# Explicit Memory Control

JavaScript has no `free()`. For most programs that's the right default — Perry's
generational GC (see [Memory Model](https://docs.perryts.com/internals/memory-model.html)) decides when to collect.
But latency-sensitive programs (games, interactive UIs) and programs that churn
large binary buffers sometimes need to *choose the moment*: run the collection
between frames, not in the middle of one; release a 100 MB texture now, not at
the next full cycle. Perry gives you two standard-shaped tools for that.

## `ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer()` (ES2024)

`transfer(newLength?)` moves an ArrayBuffer's contents into a new buffer and
**detaches** the source: its `byteLength` becomes 0, `detached` reports `true`,
views over it report length 0, and any further `transfer`/`slice`/view
construction on it throws a `TypeError`. This is standard ECMAScript — the same
code runs under Node and Bun unchanged.

```typescript,no-test
let scratch = new ArrayBuffer(64 * 1024 * 1024);
// ... use it ...
scratch = scratch.transfer(0); // detach: the 64 MB backing is released
```

Perry gives detach real teeth: buffer bytes live inline in the GC heap, so the
runtime hands the page-aligned interior of a detached payload back to the OS
immediately (`madvise`). A large detached buffer stops costing RSS the moment
you transfer it, even while the (now empty) ArrayBuffer object is still
reachable. `transferToFixedLength()` behaves identically (Perry has no
resizable ArrayBuffers), and `structuredClone(v, { transfer: [...] })` detaches
through the same path.

## `perry/gc` — collection pacing

A Perry-native module in the spirit of `perry/thread`: it compiles to direct
runtime calls and does not resolve under Node/Bun, so guard the import if the
source must also run there.

```typescript,no-test
import { collect, minor, idleHint } from "perry/gc";

collect();  // full collection now — same as the global gc()
minor();    // nursery-only collection now; returns freed bytes
idleHint(); // "this is a good moment": runs a collection only if one
            // is already due by the normal thresholds; returns whether
            // one ran. O(1) when nothing is due.
```

`idleHint()` is the one to reach for in a frame loop: call it once per frame
after presenting. When allocation pressure has made a collection imminent, it
runs at your chosen boundary instead of landing mid-frame at whatever
allocation happens to trip the threshold:

```typescript,no-test
function frame() {
  update();
  render();
  idleHint(); // GC pause (if any) happens here, not inside update()
  requestFrame(frame);
}
```

## What Perry deliberately does NOT provide

A `free(value)` / `forget(value)` API. With a tracing GC, "free this object
now" is either equivalent to dropping the reference (which the compiler already
tracks) or it dangles every other reference to the object — a use-after-free
factory. The two mechanisms above cover the real use cases — bulk binary data
(`transfer`) and pause timing (`perry/gc`) — without making any correct program
crash.

<!-- source: docs/src/internals/gc-step-bounds.md -->

# What the incremental collector's step budget actually bounds

`js_gc_step_us(budget_us)` and the mutator-assist paths advertise a *time*
budget. They implement it like this:

```rust
let mut result = gc_budgeted_step_work_units_inner(1);
while result.status == ACTIVE && start.elapsed().as_micros() < budget_us {
    result = gc_budgeted_step_work_units_inner(1);
}
```

The clock is consulted **between** work units and never during one. So the
advertised budget is only as strong as the most expensive single unit, and any
unit whose cost scales with the heap makes the budget a statement of intent
rather than a bound. This page records which phases are bounded, which are
deliberately not, and how to see the difference in a real run.

## The three regimes

| phase | per-unit cost | bounded by the step budget? |
|---|---|---|
| marking / trace drain | one object per unit | **yes** |
| weak processing | one holder **or one FinalizationRegistry record** per unit | **yes**, since #7903 |
| final root remark | root-set scan **plus** the transitive drain of everything it newly reaches | **no — deliberately atomic** |

### Weak processing was unbounded until #7903

A `FinalizationRegistry` is one registered weak *holder*, and weak processing
used to charge one work unit per holder while
`process_finreg_after_mark` walked that holder's entire record array inside the
unit. One registry with a million registrations was therefore one atomic,
heap-sized "work unit" sitting behind a time-budgeted API.

`crates/perry-runtime/src/weakref/sliced.rs` now keeps a cursor *into* the
record array and charges one unit per record. The module docs carry the full
argument; the part worth repeating here is why the cursor cannot simply be an
index.

Between two steps the mutator runs.
`FinalizationRegistry.prototype.unregister` **rebuilds** the entries array
without the matching records, so every index after a removed element shifts
down. A resumed index-only cursor would skip exactly as many records as were
removed before it — and a skipped record is a weak slot that never gets
tombstoned. On a non-moving budgeted cycle its target is then swept and the slot
is left dangling. That hazard is precisely why the array was atomic in the first
place; the old code said so in a comment.

So the cursor carries the **identity** of the array it indexes: the value word
of the registry's `entries` field plus that array's length. Both mutation paths
change one of the two (`unregister` installs a freshly built array; `register`
pushes). On resume the identity is re-read and compared, and a mismatch restarts
that registry's scan from index 0 against the new array. Restarting is safe
because a rescan is idempotent — the first pass writes `undefined` into a
collected record's target and `false` into its pending flag after enqueueing, so
a second pass over the same record enqueues nothing and clears nothing twice.

Restart-on-mutation alone is livelock-shaped, so restarts are capped
(`MAX_REGISTRY_RESTARTS`); past the cap the registry is finished in one atomic
pass and **charged as such** in `weak_registry_atomic_finishes`. The bound is
therefore explicit: per-step weak work is at most the requested budget, plus at
most one forced atomic registry pass per registry per cycle.

### Final root remark is atomic on purpose

`AtomicFinalizeSubphase::FinalRootRemark` re-scans every root with the marks
nearly final, then drains everything that re-scan newly discovered, both with
`usize::MAX`. The root scan really is bounded by root-set size. **The drain is
not** — a root installed after the initial scan can anchor an arbitrarily large
graph, and the code's older inline claim that the phase was "bounded by
root-set size, not heap size" did not cover it.

Two ways to make it bounded were considered and rejected:

- **Yield mid-drain.** Returning to the mutator between the remark scan and weak
  processing invalidates the remark itself: the mutator can install new roots,
  so the scan would have to be repeated, and repeating it to a fixpoint is not
  guaranteed to terminate under an adversarial mutator.
- **Yield after the liveness decision.** This is the correctness race tracked in
  #7900. Weak processing must observe a *complete* mark set; handing control
  back once liveness has been decided but before the weak slots are tombstoned
  lets the mutator observe a target that the collector has already condemned.

So the phase stays atomic, and the project's obligation is to **measure it
rather than claim it**. `final_remark_max_us` is that measurement.

## Seeing it in a run

`PERRY_GC_DIAG=1` (no `PERRY_GC_TRACE` needed, and no new env knob) prints:

```
[gc-step-bounds] step_max_us= final_remark_max_us= final_remarks= \
                 weak_records= weak_max_records_per_step= weak_steps_sliced= \
                 weak_registry_restarts= weak_registry_atomic_finishes=
```

- `step_max_us` is the honest answer to "how long is a step". Compare it against
  `GC_NORMAL_INCREMENTAL_SOFT_PAUSE_US` (2 000) and
  `GC_MUTATOR_ASSIST_SOFT_PAUSE_US` (500).
- `final_remark_max_us` is reported **separately and on purpose**. Folding an
  intentionally-atomic phase into the general maximum would let a heap-sized
  pause hide behind "the collector's worst step".
- `weak_steps_sliced` is the **subject-was-live counter**. A run reporting `0`
  has not exercised the sliced path at all, however green everything else looks.
  Do not read a zero here as "slicing works"; read it as "slicing did not
  happen". Most programs register no weak holders and will legitimately report
  zeros across this whole line — which is exactly why the acceptance tests drive
  the counters directly rather than inferring them from a corpus run.

  ★ **A nonzero value proves less than it looks, and this was measured rather
  than reasoned about.** A step can end "mid-registry" at the *entry park* — its
  budget already spent resolving the holder, so the cursor is stashed before a
  single record is scanned. Sabotaging the slice so that one unit swallows the
  whole array still leaves this counter nonzero. The quantity that actually
  discriminates is `weak_max_records_per_step`: under that sabotage it reads the
  full array length instead of the budget. Use the pair, not the flag alone.

# Local binding type evidence

Perry compiles TypeScript, but TypeScript annotations do not exist at runtime.
The compiler must therefore distinguish three statements that look similar in
source code:

1. a binding is *declared* as `T`;
2. a binding's initializer happened to produce `T`; and
3. the value at this use site is proven to have representation `T`.

Only the third statement can license an unguarded specialized lowering or a
compile-time answer. An initializer can establish it only when the expression's
own runtime semantics fix the kind and no later write can replace the value.

## The invariant

> A type or kind fact attached to a local binding is usable only if every write
> that could invalidate it is excluded. A declared TypeScript type is never a
> runtime representation proof by itself.

A later assignment is the invalidating event. The current implementation uses
a conservative whole-region rule: if a binding is assigned anywhere after its
declaration, initializer-derived evidence disappears for the whole region.
Declared annotations never enter the proof map. This can miss an optimization
before the write, but it cannot let a non-dominating write silently change the
meaning of a later operation.

This is intentionally stricter than statement-order tracking. A future CFG
analysis may recover hints at sites dominated by a validating guard, but the
fallback must remain the runtime path.

## Codegen APIs

`FnCtx` exposes two reads:

- `stable_local_type_proof(id)` reads a separate map populated only by
  initializer expressions whose runtime semantics establish their outer kind,
  and returns no type when the region contains a write to `id`.
- `local_type_hint(id)` is the narrow escape hatch for a consumer with an
  independent representation proof or a runtime guard that validates the
  current value. It deliberately preserves the hint across assignment.

Initializer proofs are deliberately syntax-based. Literal primitives,
primitive operators whose operands are already proven, array/object literals,
closures, and the outer Object result of `new` qualify. A specialized method
HIR node does not: it may retain an override-aware fallback with a different
result kind. Class identity and generic element types are likewise not inferred
from the outer allocation alone.

Examples of valid escape-hatch uses include a typed-array runtime helper that
checks the receiver's actual GC kind, a scalar clone entered behind a public tag
guard, and a buffer-view slot whose pointer state every write invalidates.

Examples that are not valid proofs include `number`, `boolean`, or `string` on
a local declaration; a property or function return type propagated from an
annotation; and a method name guessed without validating the receiver. Nested
generic claims are erased: an intrinsic can prove Array without proving the
declared types of its future elements.

The precise-GC pointer collector follows the same rule independently. It roots
every generic-ABI parameter and every local until the complete write set proves
that all values are non-pointers. A scalar annotation can therefore never
suppress a root for an object actually stored in that binding. Typed closure
capture annotations are only candidates: both the public trampoline and the
direct local-call path validate every current capture slot and branch to the
generic body on failure.

Module globals used by worker-thread admission have a separate structural
initializer map and a module-wide write check. Missing evidence is hazardous;
a transferable-looking annotation cannot make an arbitrary main-heap value
safe to read from another worker arena.

For operator selection, use the stronger per-value predicates where available.
For example, `string_value_is_runtime_guaranteed` separates a value constructed
as a string from one that is merely declared as a string. Bare local truthiness
always uses `js_is_truthy`, because numeric and boolean annotations can hold
any NaN-boxed value.

## Static inventory and CI gate

`scripts/local_binding_type_audit.py` scans production HIR/codegen sources for
both accessors and for remaining lower-level type-map reads. Its count-exact
inventory is `scripts/local_binding_type_allowlist.json`.

Each inventory group states one of three verdicts:

- `runtime-validated`: emitted code checks the current runtime value;
- `representation-proven`: another analysis establishes the storage fact and
  invalidates it on writes;
- `metadata-only`: the type read cannot select a runtime answer or layout.

The gate fails when a consumer is added without a verdict, when a count changes,
when an entry matches nothing, or when code bypasses the accessors with a direct
read of the hint or proof maps. Its self-test plants both bypass forms, all
inventory drift modes, and an empty scan, so a stale scanner cannot report a
vacuous success.
